# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
Project submission
Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

7.merge the dataset
8.set the names to variable
9.Merge columns to get the data frame for all data
10.Extracts only the measurments on the mean and standard deviation for each measurment
11.subset the data frame by selected names of features
12.uses descriptive activity names to namethe activities in the data set
13.Appropriate labels the data set with desciptive variable names
14.create second independent dataset
